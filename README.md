# Jetpack Compose Showcase

## Overview

Welcome to the Jetpack Compose Showcase project! This Android application is a comprehensive demonstration of modern Android development using the Jetpack Compose UI toolkit, Kotlin, and other cutting-edge technologies. The project showcases the power of Jetpack Compose in building reactive and declarative user interfaces while adhering to the MVVM architecture with Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI:** Leverages Jetpack Compose for building modern, reactive, and declarative user interfaces.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Demonstrates the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Dagger Hilt:** Utilizes Dagger Hilt for efficient dependency injection, ensuring a modular and testable codebase.
- **State Flow and Effect Handler:** Implements State Flow for managing UI-related state and Effect Handler for handling side effects.
- **Navigation Component:** Utilizes the Navigation Component for seamless navigation between different screens.
- **Rest API Integration:** Makes use of Retrofit for efficient and type-safe communication with RESTful APIs.
- **Glide for Image Loading:** Integrates Glide for efficient loading and caching of images.
- **Jetpack Viewmodel:** Implements Jetpack ViewModel to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main packages:

1. **Simple Package:**
   - Contains screens demonstrating a simple category and products display using Jetpack Compose.
   - Illustrates the basic usage of Compose for building UI components with api calling using mvvm archietcture.

2. **Practice Package:**
   - Includes practice files for screens, state examples, and other Compose-related features.
   - Ideal for developers who want to explore and practice Jetpack Compose concepts.

## Usage

Clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device to explore the Jetpack Compose features, MVVM architecture, and Dagger Hilt integration. Check out the practice package for hands-on experience with Jetpack Compose.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or adapt the codebase for your projects. This project serves as a valuable resource for those diving into Jetpack Compose and modern Android development.

Happy composing!
